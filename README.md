# 🧠 Problem Solver & Solution Designer

Hi, I'm Jun Zhang — a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Lead Engineer at JLR, a designer with strong engineering sensibilities, and a problem solver driven by curiosity and aesthetics.

## 🌍 What this space is about

With the rise of cutting-edge AI technologies, the landscape of product development is evolving. Ideas can now turn into real, functioning code faster than ever. As someone deeply involved in both design and implementation, I see this moment as a turning point.

This GitHub space is my playground for:

- ✏️ **Designing solutions** that solve real-world problems with clarity and intention  
- 🔬 **Exploring interactions** that blend technical excellence with human intuition  
- 💡 **Prototyping concepts** — from visual interfaces to responsive behaviors  
- 🧩 **Connecting systems** across front-end, logic, and emerging frameworks  

Whether it’s breathing life into sketches or refining interaction flows, I aim to become:

> 🎯 **The most technically grounded designer and the most design-driven developer**

## 🛠 Current Explorations

This repository showcases a mix of:
- Web UI prototypes
- Interaction experiments
- Visual storytelling modules
- AI-powered workflow integrations

All experiments start with questions, not answers. Let's explore what’s possible when design meets computation.

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to exchanging ideas with other hybrid thinkers. If you see something you want to build on — fork it, remix it, or drop me a message.
